# WordPress version used in first build configuration.
env:
    - WP_VERSION=master

# Next we define our matrix of additional build configurations to test against.
# The versions listed above will automatically create our first configuration,
# so it doesn't need to be re-defined below.

# WP_VERSION specifies the tag to use. The way these tests are configured to run
# requires at least WordPress 3.8. Specify "master" to test against SVN trunk.

# Note that Travis CI supports listing these above to automatically build a
# matrix of configurations, but we're being nice here by manually building a
# total of four configurations even though we're testing 4 versions of PHP
# along with 2 versions of WordPress (which would build 8 configs otherwise).
# This takes half as long to run while still providing adequate coverage.
